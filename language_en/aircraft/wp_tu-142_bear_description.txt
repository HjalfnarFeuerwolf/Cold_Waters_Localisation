AircraftDescriptiveName=Tupolev TU-142 Bear F
History=The Tu-142 is a derivative of the Tu-95 strategic bomber. While ostensibly performing the same role as the Il-38 May, the Tu-142 features much greater range and loiter capability, and carries a much larger payload than the May. Their main drawback is their incredibly high noise output, which is loud enough to be tracked on US SOSUS arrays.
